Flask App:-
===========
a) Create a Dockerfile with the necessary instructions to build the image.
b) Ensure you have a requirements.txt listing your Flask dependencies.
c) Build the Docker image using docker build -t pyflask .
d) Run the Docker container with docker run -dit --name flaskapp -p 80:5000 pyflask
e) Access your Flask app at http://localhost:80

This is a basic flask app docker container. To run it locally, execute the commands below,

docker build -t pyflask .                                     //To build docker image in the current directory
docker images                                                //To list out docker images
docker run -dit --name app -p 80:5000 pyflask               //To run docker container in detached mode
docker ps                                                  //To check the running container process
docker stop <CONTAINER_ID>                                //To stop the running container
docker container prune                                   //To delete stopped container

When the container is running, it will be attached to port 80 of the local machine, go to: http://localhost:80 to view the site.

Note: Flask, by default, is running on port 5000 of the container, but we mapped to host port 80 to container port 5000.
