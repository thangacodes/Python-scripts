Socket Programming in Python:
Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. 
One socket(node) listens on a particular port at an IP, while the other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection. 
The server forms the listener socket while the client reaches out to the server.
